# Modular-3D-printed-Platform-For-In-vivo-MRI
Our open source modular low-cost 3D holder provides robust and easily reproducible setup for in-vivo application for mice anesthetized or awake, and rats with minimal intervention. 


Updated version of the holder will be available soon. We are in the process of writing a publication. Once we are published, the most recent files will be available for download.
